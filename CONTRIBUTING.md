# Contributing to NOMAD v2.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NOMAD (Notable Object Monitoring And Analysis Director) v2.0! This project is designed to make threat intelligence accessible through natural conversation with Claude Code.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security First

NOMAD is a **defensive security tool only**. All contributions must align with this principle:

‚úÖ **Acceptable contributions:**
- Threat intelligence feed improvements
- Agent behavior enhancements
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes and performance optimizations
- New defensive analysis features

‚ùå **Unacceptable contributions:**
- Offensive security tools or techniques
- Credential harvesting capabilities
- Any malicious functionality
- Tools that could be used to harm systems or individuals

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Claude Code (https://claude.ai/code)
- Basic understanding of threat intelligence concepts
- Familiarity with markdown for agent template editing

### Development Environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/nomad-threat-intel-framework
cd nomad-threat-intel-framework
claude code
```

No additional setup required - NOMAD v2.0 runs entirely within Claude Code!

- Add new analysis capabilities

### 2. Threat Feed Enhancements
- Add new legitimate threat intelligence sources
- Improve feed parsing logic
- Enhance data quality validation
- Update industry-specific templates

### 3. Configuration Templates
- Update `config/threat-sources-templates.json`
- Add new industry-specific feed packages
- Improve default user preferences

### 4. Documentation
- README improvements
- Agent behavior documentation
- Usage examples and tutorials

## üîß Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. **Test locally** using Claude Code natural language queries
4. **Commit changes** with clear, descriptive messages
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with detailed description

### Testing Your Changes
Since NOMAD v2.0 uses conversational interfaces:
1. Launch Claude Code in your development environment
2. Test queries like:
   - "Show me latest threats"
   - "Add healthcare feeds"
   - "Configure my preferences"
3. Verify agent responses match expected behavior
4. Test edge cases and error handling

### Code Style
- **Agent Templates**: Use clear, professional language in markdown
- **Configuration Files**: Follow existing JSON structure and naming conventions
- **Documentation**: Use GitHub-flavored markdown with clear headings

## üìù Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting
- [ ] Test your changes thoroughly with Claude Code
- [ ] Update relevant documentation
