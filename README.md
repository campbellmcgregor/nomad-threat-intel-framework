## What is NOMAD?

NOMAD (Notable Object Monitoring And Analysis Director) is a Claude Code-native threat intelligence framework. Built on the modern plugin architecture, it uses **skills**, **hooks**, **agents**, and **MCP integrations** to deliver personalized, actionable threat intelligence through natural conversation.

### Key Features

- 🎯 **21 Skills** organized into 5 groups (threats, feeds, config, reporting, system)
- 🤖 **8 Specialized Agents** for multi-step threat intelligence workflows
- 🔗 **7 Hooks** for validation, security, and audit logging
- 🌐 **MCP Integration** for real-time NVD, EPSS, and CISA KEV data
- 📊 **Admiralty Rating System** for source reliability grading
- 👑 **Crown Jewel Correlation** for asset-specific threat prioritization

## Natural Language Interface

NOMAD understands natural language queries:

```
"What's critical today?"          → /critical
"Tell me about CVE-2024-12345"    → /cve CVE-2024-12345
"Threats to my web servers"       → /crown-jewel
"Brief me for leadership"         → /executive-brief
"Add healthcare feeds"            → /add-feeds healthcare
```

## Configuration

### Organization Profile (`config/user-preferences.json`)

```json
{
  "organization": {
    "name": "Your Organization",
    "industry": "Technology"
  },
  "crown_jewels": [
    "Web Application Servers",
    "Database Systems",
    "Authentication Infrastructure"
  ],
  "threat_preferences": {
    "minimum_severity": "medium",
    "focus_areas": ["Remote code execution", "Authentication bypass"]
  }
}
```

### Verification Methods

| Method | Cost | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|

| `hybrid` | ~$5-10/mo | Both methods combined |

Configure with `/setup-verification`.

## Data Sources

### Government CERTs
- CISA Cybersecurity Advisories
- CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV)
- NCSC UK, CERT-EU, Canadian Cyber Centre
- Australian Cyber Security Centre

### Vendor Advisories
- Microsoft Security Response Center
- Cisco Security Advisories
- And more via RSS feeds

### Enrichment APIs
- **NVD**: CVE details and CVSS scores
- **EPSS**: Exploit probability scoring
- **CISA KEV**: Active exploitation status

## Hooks System

NOMAD includes 7 hooks for validation and security:

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `load-nomad-context` | SessionStart | Load config, check cache |
| `validate-cve-format` | UserPromptSubmit | CVE format validation |
| `check-setup-completion` | UserPromptSubmit | Setup verification |

## Admiralty Rating System

All intelligence is rated using the NATO Admiralty Code:

- **Source Reliability**: A (Completely reliable) → F (Cannot be judged)
- **Information Credibility**: 1 (Confirmed) → 6 (Cannot be judged)

Example: `A1` = Completely reliable source, confirmed information
