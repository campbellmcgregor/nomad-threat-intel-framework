   - Get total threat count and priority distribution
   - Access processed threat intelligence

3. **Execute Query Handler**: Use the Task tool to invoke the query-handler agent with the request "Show me latest threats" including full user context

4. **Generate Briefing**: The system should provide a personalized briefing showing:
   - Critical/High/Medium threat counts
   - Specific threats affecting user's crown jewels
   - Business impact context for their industry
   - Immediate actions required

## Data Freshness

If threat data is stale (>6 hours old), automatically trigger a refresh by coordinating the threat-collector and intelligence-processor agents before generating the briefing.
