# setup-verification

Configure threat intelligence verification settings for validating threats against authoritative sources.

## Usage
/setup-verification

## Description
Interactive wizard to configure NOMAD's verification system, including method selection, API keys, confidence thresholds, and cost limits.

## Interactive Flow

The command guides you through:

1. **Choose Verification Method**
   - Structured APIs Only (free, official sources like NVD/CISA)
   - Jina.ai Grounding Only (paid, comprehensive web verification)
   - Hybrid Approach (recommended - combines both methods)
   - Disabled (no verification for testing/emergency)

2. **Configure Jina.ai (if selected)**
   - Enter API key
   - Set monthly budget limit
   - Configure confidence threshold

3. **Set Confidence Thresholds**
   - Minimum display threshold (default: 50%)
   - Critical threat threshold (default: 70%)
   - Actionable threat threshold (default: 60%)

4. **Configure Cost Limits** (if using Jina.ai)
   - Monthly budget cap
   - Alert threshold
   - Behavior when limit reached

5. **Test Verification**
   - Run sample verification
   - Display results and confidence scores

## Examples

### Initial Setup
```
User: /setup-verification
NOMAD: üîê VERIFICATION CONFIGURATION WIZARD

I'll help you set up threat verification to ensure all intelligence is validated against authoritative sources.

Choose your verification method:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Structured APIs Only** (Free)
   - Uses NVD, CISA KEV, vendor APIs
   - No cost, official sources only
   - Good for budget-conscious teams

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Jina.ai Grounding** (Paid)
   - Real-time web verification
   - $0.001 per request (~$10/month typical)
   - Most comprehensive coverage

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Hybrid Approach** (Recommended)
   - Combines both methods
   - Weighted scoring for best accuracy
   - Balances cost and coverage

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Disabled**
   - No verification (testing only)
   - All threats marked unverified

Which method would you prefer? (1-4):
```

### Jina.ai Configuration
```
User: 3
NOMAD: Great choice! The hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds.

To use Jina.ai grounding, I'll need your API key.
Get one at: https://jina.ai/api

Enter your Jina.ai API key (or press Enter to skip):
```

### Confidence Thresholds
```
NOMAD: Now let's set your confidence thresholds.

These determine which threats to display based on verification confidence:

‚Ä¢ **Minimum Display** (current: 50%)
  Threats below this won't be shown

‚Ä¢ **Critical Threshold** (current: 70%)
  Minimum confidence for critical alerts

‚Ä¢ **Actionable Threshold** (current: 60%)
  Minimum confidence for remediation recommendations

Keep defaults? (Y/n):
```

### Cost Management
```
NOMAD: Let's configure cost controls for Jina.ai:

Monthly budget (USD): $10
Alert when spending reaches: $8
When limit reached: [Fall back to structured APIs only]

Is this correct? (Y/n):
```

### Test Verification
```
NOMAD: üß™ Testing verification with a known threat...

Testing CVE-2024-3400 (Palo Alto Networks Critical):
‚úÖ NVD API: Success (CVSS 10.0 confirmed)
‚úÖ CISA KEV: Listed (active exploitation)
‚úÖ Jina.ai: 5 sources found
   - Palo Alto advisory
   - BleepingComputer article
   - CISA alert

Verification Result:
‚Ä¢ Confidence: 98%
‚Ä¢ Method: Hybrid
‚Ä¢ Response time: 3.2 seconds
‚Ä¢ Cost: $0.001

‚úÖ Verification system configured successfully!
```

- Verification adds 3-6 seconds to threat processing
- Cache hit rate improves performance over time
- You can change methods anytime without losing data
