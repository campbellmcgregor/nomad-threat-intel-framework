2. **Search Local Cache**: Check `data/threats-cache.json` for:
   - Exact CVE match in threats array
   - CVE mentioned in related threats
   - Associated threat intelligence

3. **Enhance if Needed**: If CVE not in cache or lacks detail:
   - Use Task tool to invoke intelligence-processor agent
   - Fetch data from NVD, EPSS, KEV databases
   - Enrich with current threat intelligence

4. **User Context Analysis**:
   - Check if CVE affects user's crown jewels
   - Assess impact to user's industry/technology stack
   - Determine priority level for this organization

5. **Generate Detailed Report**: Use threat-synthesizer for comprehensive CVE analysis
