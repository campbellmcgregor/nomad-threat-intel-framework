description: Force refresh of threat intelligence data from all sources
---

You are executing the `/refresh` command for NOMAD v2.0. This command forces an immediate refresh of threat intelligence data from all configured feeds, bypassing normal caching intervals.

## Command Execution

1. **Show Current Status**: Display last refresh time and cache status
2. **Feed Health Check**: Validate all configured feeds are accessible
3. **Force Collection**: Use Task tool to invoke threat-collector agent for immediate data gathering
4. **Process Intelligence**: Route new threats through intelligence-processor
5. **Update Cache**: Refresh `data/threats-cache.json` with latest data
6. **Generate Summary**: Show refresh results and new threats discovered

## Refresh Triggers

The refresh command is useful when:
- **Scheduled Refresh Failed**: Normal automation didn't run
- **Major Security Event**: Need immediate intelligence on breaking news
- **Feed Configuration Changes**: After adding new sources
- **Manual Override**: Force collection outside normal intervals
- **Quality Concerns**: Validate feed health and data freshness

## Performance Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Respects feed source rate limits
- **Parallel Collection**: Processes multiple feeds simultaneously
- **Error Handling**: Continues if some feeds fail
- **Cache Protection**: Maintains previous data if refresh fails
- **Resource Management**: Monitors system resources during collection

## Refresh Intervals

Default refresh schedule:
- **Critical Feeds**: Every 15 minutes
- **High Priority**: Every 30 minutes
- **Medium Priority**: Every 2 hours
- **Low Priority**: Every 6 hours
- **Manual Refresh**: On-demand with this command

Execute this command now to force immediate threat intelligence collection and processing from all configured sources.
