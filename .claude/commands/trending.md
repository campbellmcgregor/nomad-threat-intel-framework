You are executing the `/trending` command for NOMAD v2.0. This command identifies and presents trending threats, attack vectors, and emerging patterns in the current threat landscape.

## Command Execution

1. **Analyze Threat Patterns**: Read `data/threats-cache.json` and identify:
   - Most frequently mentioned CVEs
   - Recurring threat actors
   - Common attack vectors
   - Vendor/technology targets
   - Geographic or industry targeting patterns

2. **Temporal Analysis**: Look for:
   - Threats with recent publication dates (last 7-14 days)
   - Escalating EPSS scores
   - New KEV additions
   - Evolving exploitation status (PoC â†’ ITW)

3. **Industry Context**: Apply user context from `config/user-preferences.json`:
   - Filter trends relevant to user's industry
   - Highlight patterns affecting user's technology stack
   - Show trends impacting crown jewel systems

4. **Generate Trend Report**: Use threat-synthesizer to create comprehensive trending analysis
