You are executing the `/import-feeds` command for NOMAD v2.0. This command imports threat intelligence feeds from various file formats.

## Command Parameters

- `$1`: File path to import (OPML, JSON, or CSV format)
- If no parameter: Guide user through import process

## Command Execution

1. **File Format Detection**: If file path provided:
   - Detect format by extension (.opml, .json, .csv)
   - Validate file exists and is readable
   - Parse file structure to confirm format

2. **Import Processing**: Use Task tool to invoke feed-manager agent with:
   - File path and format
   - Current user configuration
   - Request for feed import and validation

3. **Validation & Quality Check**: For each imported feed:
   - Validate URL accessibility
   - Check RSS/Atom format compliance
   - Assess security relevance score
   - Detect duplicates with existing feeds

4. **Integration**: Merge with current configuration:
   - Avoid duplicates
   - Categorize by source type
   - Apply appropriate priority levels
   - Update user feed configuration

üì• FEED IMPORT WIZARD

NOMAD can import threat intelligence feeds from:

üìÑ SUPPORTED FORMATS:

‚Ä¢ JSON (.json) - Custom feed configurations
‚Ä¢ CSV (.csv) - Spreadsheet format with feed lists

üìã REQUIRED INFORMATION:
‚Ä¢ Feed Name (descriptive title)
‚Ä¢ Feed URL (RSS/Atom endpoint)
‚Ä¢ Priority (critical/high/medium/low) [optional]
‚Ä¢ Description [optional]

üîç EXAMPLE USAGE:
/import-feeds ~/Downloads/my-feeds.opml
/import-feeds ./custom-feeds.json
/import-feeds feeds-list.csv

üìÅ FILE PREPARATION TIPS:

OPML Files:
‚Ä¢ Export from your RSS reader (Feedly: Settings ‚Üí OPML)
‚Ä¢ Ensure xmlUrl attributes contain RSS/Atom URLs

JSON Files:
