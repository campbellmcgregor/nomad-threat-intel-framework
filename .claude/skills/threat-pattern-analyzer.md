## Processing Instructions

### Stage 1: Data Aggregation & Preprocessing

1. **Load Historical Threat Data**:
   - Read `data/threats-cache.json`
   - Filter by time window (start_date to end_date)
   - Extract threats within filter criteria
   - Normalize dates to UTC
   - Sort chronologically

2. **Time-Series Preparation**:
   - Group threats by time granularity (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Calculate counts per time bucket
   - Calculate severity averages per time bucket
   - Identify missing data points (gaps in time series)
   - Interpolate missing values if appropriate

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Extract CVEs, attack vectors, affected products
   - Identify threat actors from descriptions
   - Tag threats by industry relevance
   - Classify by severity, urgency, impact

### Stage 2: Trend Detection

1. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - Calculate occurrence rate for each threat/CVE
   - Compare current period to previous periods
   - Calculate percentage change
   - Determine trend direction:
     - `emerging`: New in current period, accelerating
     - `rising`: Increasing frequency (>20% growth)
     - `stable`: Relatively constant (±20%)
     - `declining`: Decreasing frequency (<-20%)

2. **Trend Scoring Algorithm**:
```
Trend Score (0-100) = (
  Frequency_Weight * 30 +
  Growth_Rate_Weight * 25 +
  Severity_Weight * 20 +
  Source_Diversity_Weight * 15 +
  Recency_Weight * 10
)

Where:
- Frequency_Weight = (current_count / max_count_seen) * 100
- Growth_Rate_Weight = min(100, (growth_percentage / 100) * 100)
- Severity_Weight = (average_cvss / 10) * 100
- Source_Diversity_Weight = (unique_sources / total_sources) * 100
- Recency_Weight = (days_since_last / max_days) * 100
```

3. **Acceleration Detection**:
   - Calculate first derivative (rate of change)
   - Calculate second derivative (acceleration)
   - Identify exponential growth patterns
   - Flag rapid acceleration (potential outbreak)

### Stage 3: Pattern Recognition

1. **Attack Vector Clustering**:
   - Group threats by attack vector
   - Calculate vector frequency over time
   - Identify shifting attack preferences
   - Cluster similar attack methods

2. **Vulnerability Family Detection**:
   - Analyze CVE descriptions for commonalities
   - Group by affected product/vendor
   - Identify common root causes (e.g., buffer overflow family)
   - Detect patch regression patterns (similar issues re-emerging)

3. **Attack Chain Reconstruction**:
   - Map CVEs to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
   - Identify common technique sequences
   - Build attack chain models
   - Correlate initial access → privilege escalation → lateral movement patterns

### Stage 4: Campaign Correlation

1. **Threat Actor Attribution**:
   - Extract threat actor mentions from threat descriptions
   - Correlate by techniques, timing, targets
   - Build actor activity profiles
   - Track actor evolution over time

2. **Campaign Detection**:
   - Group threats by:
     - Temporal proximity (within 7-14 days)
     - Target similarity (same industry/technology)
     - Technique overlap (>50% common TTPs)
     - Infrastructure connections (C2 patterns)
   - Assign campaign confidence scores
   - Name campaigns descriptively

3. **Targeting Analysis**:
   - Identify industries most frequently targeted
   - Detect technology-specific targeting
   - Assess crown jewel relevance
   - Map to user's risk surface

### Stage 5: Anomaly Detection

1. **Statistical Anomaly Detection**:
   - Calculate baseline metrics:
     - Mean threat volume per time period
     - Standard deviation
     - Normal ranges (±2σ)
   - Identify outliers:
     - Volume spikes (>3σ above mean)
     - Severity increases (avg CVSS +2.0 or more)
     - Unusual sources (new feed with high volume)
   - Calculate deviation significance

2. **Pattern-Based Anomaly Detection**:
   - Detect deviations from temporal patterns
   - Identify unexpected attack vectors
   - Flag unusual target industries
   - Detect sudden threat actor emergence

3. **Contextual Anomaly Detection**:
   - Compare to industry baselines
   - Identify organization-specific anomalies
   - Detect crown jewel targeting increases
   - Flag coordinated attack indicators

### Stage 6: Predictive Analysis

1. **Time-Series Forecasting**:
   - Apply forecasting models:
     - Moving average for stable trends
     - Exponential smoothing for accelerating trends
     - Linear regression for growth/decline
   - Generate predictions for next 7, 14, 30 days
   - Calculate prediction confidence intervals

2. **Pattern-Based Predictions**:
   - Identify historical patterns that repeat
   - Detect seasonal cycles (if enough data)
   - Project pattern continuations
   - Estimate emergence likelihood for new threats

3. **Campaign Expansion Prediction**:
   - Analyze historical campaign spread rates
   - Predict geographic/industry expansion
   - Estimate timeline for reaching your organization
   - Calculate impact probability

4. **Zero-Day Indicators**:
   - Detect vulnerability family patterns suggesting new variants
   - Identify products with recurring issues
   - Flag technologies due for major vulnerabilities (based on patterns)
   - Calculate zero-day risk scores for technologies

### Stage 7: Synthesis & Recommendations

1. **Priority Ranking**:
   - Rank trending threats by:
     - Trend score
     - Crown jewel relevance
     - Exploitation likelihood
     - Predicted impact
   - Apply threat appetite filter (conservative/balanced/aggressive)

2. **Actionable Recommendations**:
   - **Critical Priority**:
     - Patch trending high-CVSS vulnerabilities
     - Monitor for campaign indicators
     - Implement compensating controls for predicted threats
   - **High Priority**:
     - Enhance detection for emerging attack vectors
     - Review crown jewel exposure to trending threats
     - Strengthen defenses in targeted areas
   - **Medium/Low Priority**:
     - Intelligence gathering on threat actors
     - Long-term architecture improvements
     - Feed optimization based on trends

3. **Report Generation**:
   - Format trending threats for executive consumption
   - Provide technical details for SOC teams
   - Include visual trend charts
   - Deliver predictive alerts with timelines
