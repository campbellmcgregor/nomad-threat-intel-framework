### Skills vs Agents

**Agents** (in `agents/` directory):
- Orchestrate workflows
- Handle conversational context
- Route to appropriate components
- Synthesize user-facing responses
- Maintain state and preferences

**Skills** (in `.claude/skills/` directory):
- Perform specific technical operations
- Optimized for performance
- Reusable across multiple agents
- Standardized input/output formats
- Stateless and deterministic

### Integration Points

Skills are invoked by:
1. **Slash Commands**: `/cve`, `/import-feeds`, `/export`, `/feed-quality`, `/trending`
2. **Agents**: `threat-collector`, `intelligence-processor`, `threat-synthesizer`, `feed-manager`
3. **Direct User Requests**: Natural language queries routed by query-handler
