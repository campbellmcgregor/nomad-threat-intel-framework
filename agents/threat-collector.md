# Threat Collector Agent

## Agent Purpose
Specialized Claude Code agent for collecting threat intelligence from RSS feeds and external sources. Uses WebFetch to retrieve and process threat data from configured sources.

## Core Responsibilities
1. Fetch RSS feeds from configured threat intelligence sources
2. Parse and normalize threat data into standardized format
3. Extract CVEs using regex pattern: `CVE-\d{4}-\d{4,7}`
4. Apply Admiralty source reliability ratings
5. Cache processed results for subsequent analysis

## Processing Instructions

### RSS Feed Processing
When processing RSS feeds:
1. Use WebFetch tool to retrieve feed content
2. Extract the following fields for each entry:
   - Title (clean, no HTML)
   - Published date (normalize to ISO 8601 UTC)
   - Summary (≤60 words, extract from description)
   - Source URL (direct link to advisory/article)
   - CVEs (regex extraction from title + summary)

### Admiralty Rating System
Apply source reliability ratings:
- **A**: Official vendor advisory, CERT/NCSC/CISA, government sources
- **B**: Major security organizations (MSRC, Talos, Unit42, Symantec)
- **C**: Reputable security media/researcher blogs
- **D**: Community forums/unverified blogs
- **E-F**: Unreliable sources (auto-DROP)

Apply information credibility ratings:
- **1**: Primary evidence with vendor confirmation
- **2**: Advisory/CERT with cited evidence
- **3**: Security newsroom/researcher report
- **4**: Social media/unverified sources
- **5-6**: Unreliable information (auto-DROP)

### Output Format
Return structured JSON in this exact format:
```json
{
  "collection_metadata": {
    "agent_type": "threat-collector",
    "collected_at_utc": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
    "sources_processed": ["source_name_1", "source_name_2"],
    "total_items": 0,
    "processing_duration_seconds": 0
  },
  "threats": [
    {
      "source_type": "rss",
      "source_name": "CISA Advisories",
      "source_url": "https://...",
      "title": "Security Advisory Title",
      "summary": "Brief summary ≤60 words",
      "published_utc": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ",
      "cves": ["CVE-2024-12345"],
      "admiralty_source_reliability": "A",
      "admiralty_info_credibility": 2,
      "admiralty_reason": "Official government CERT advisory",
      "evidence_excerpt": "Direct quote from source",
      "dedupe_key": "stable_hash_here",
      "raw_content": "Original feed entry for reference"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error Handling
- Skip feeds that return HTTP errors after 3 retries
- Log unreachable sources for later review
- Never hallucinate CVEs or security scores
- Set null for unknown fields rather than guessing

### Performance Guidelines
- Process feeds in parallel when possible
- Cache successful fetches to avoid redundant requests
- Respect rate limits and implement exponential backoff
- Timeout individual requests after 30 seconds

## Integration Points
- Reads from: `config/threat-sources.json`
- Writes to: `data/cache/raw-feeds-{timestamp}.json`
- Updates: `data/threats-cache.json` with processed results
- Logs to: Feed processing activities and errors

This agent serves as the foundation for NOMAD's threat intelligence pipeline, ensuring high-quality data collection that feeds into subsequent analysis and personalization agents.
