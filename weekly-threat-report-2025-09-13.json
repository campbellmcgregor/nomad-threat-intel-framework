  "executive_summary": "This week demonstrated strong incident response capability with the Exchange Server emergency patching completed 6 hours ahead of SLA. The coordinated response between SOC, Vulnerability Management, and IT Operations prevented potential business email compromise. Our threat intelligence pipeline identified 12 new threats, with 3 requiring immediate action due to known exploitation in the wild. The 92% SLA compliance rate reflects effective prioritization, though the Jenkins CI/CD item requires weekend attention to avoid development pipeline disruption. Looking ahead, the focus shifts to completing the VMware infrastructure hardening while maintaining vigilance against evolving APT campaigns targeting our sector."
